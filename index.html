						<h3>Life in SJTU</h3>
						<p>I received my bachelor's degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). We have a very big campus. There are four libraries and more than ten canteens. Yet, each library is full of people every day, and the canteens are always crowded during lunchtime and suppertime. Although life in SJTU is busy, it is also enjoyable. </p>

						<h3>Study Abroad</h3>
						<p>In 2019, I took the Winter Program initiated by UM-SJTU Joint Institute and went to Technische Universität Berlin for a one-month study. </p>
						<p>We had a great time there. At the end of our study, we spent a few days in Switzerland and had a great time skiing in Mürren.</p>
